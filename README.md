## **I. Main Interface Overview**

The program's interface is divided into 4 main sections:

1.  **Download Setup:** This is where you add links, manage the download queue, and choose where to save your files.
2.  **Options:** Here, you can customize the quality, format, and other content to be downloaded.
3.  **Activity Log:** Displays notifications about the download process, allowing you to monitor the program's activities.
4.  **Controls:** Contains the main buttons to start or stop the download process.

## **II. Step-by-Step Download Guide**

* **Limit:** If it's a playlist/channel, you can limit the number of videos to download (set to `0` to download all).
* **Video Type:** Choose between "Regular Videos" and "Shorts".
* **Concurrent downloads:** Select the number of videos to download simultaneously (this can speed up the process).
* **Other Options:**
  * **🎵 Audio Only:** Downloads only the audio file (MP3).
  * **⏩ Skip Video & Audio:** Downloads only auxiliary content like thumbnails or subtitles.
  * **🖼️ Download Thumbnail:** Downloads the video's thumbnail image (in .jpg format).

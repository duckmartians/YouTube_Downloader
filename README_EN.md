![Application Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/your-screenshot-link-here.png) A desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Python and Tkinter for downloading YouTube videos, playlists, and entire channels. This application leverages the powerful `yt-dlp` library, is multi-threaded to prevent UI freezing, and provides a wide range of flexible download options.

- **Quality Selection**: Choose video quality from 720p HD up to 4K, or select "Best Available" to automatically get the highest resolution.

- **Side File Downloads**: Easily download video thumbnails (PNG) and subtitles (SRT).
- **Multi-language UI**: Supports both English and Vietnamese, switchable directly within the app.
- **Download Control**: Pause, resume, and stop the download process at any time.
- **Integrated Updater**: Includes a built-in "Update Library" button to upgrade `yt-dlp` to the latest version directly from the app, helping to fix download issues caused by YouTube's changes.
